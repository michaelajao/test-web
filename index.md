# Michael Ajao-Olarinoye
### Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Educator

Welcome to my portfolio! I specialize in using **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science** to solve real-world problems. I am currently pursuing a PhD at Coventry University, focusing on optimizing resource allocation during pandemics. I also enjoy mentoring and educating future data scientists.

## Projects
- **[COVID-19 Forecasting](projects/covid-19)**: Deep learning model to predict COVID-19 hospitalization.
- **[Customer Churn Prediction](projects/churn)**: Machine learning model to predict customer churn.

## Publications
- **[Physics-Informed Neural Networks](publications/pinn)**: A research paper on applying PINNs to optimize healthcare resource allocation.
- **[Deep Learning for Time-Series Analysis](publications/timeseries)**: My work on using LSTMs for time-series analysis.

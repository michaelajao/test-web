### Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Educator

Welcome to my personal portfolio. I am passionate about leveraging data and machine learning to solve real-world problems, and I have over five years of experience in academia and industry. My work spans various domains, from **data science** and **AI-driven solutions** to **teaching and mentorship**.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a **PhD in Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling** at **Coventry University**, with a research focus on **optimising resource allocation during pandemics** using advanced AI and machine learning techniques. I have a strong background in:

- **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**
- **Data Science** and **Big Data Analytics**
- **Computational Modelling** for public health
- **Time Series Analysis**

In addition to my research, I am dedicated to teaching. As a **Graduate Teaching Assistant**, I mentor undergraduate and postgraduate students, helping them master complex concepts in **artificial intelligence**, **data science**, and **machine learning**.

My ultimate goal is to make cutting-edge AI and data science more accessible and to help foster the next generation of data professionals.

## Research and Projects

Here are some of my key projects and research contributions:

- **COVID-19 Hospitalisation Forecasting**: Developed a deep learning model using LSTM to forecast hospitalisation trends during the COVID-19 pandemic with 95% accuracy.
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Built a machine learning model to predict customer churn, achieving 88% accuracy, and provided actionable insights for business decision-making.
- **Fuzzy Logic Controller for Greenhouses**: Applied genetic algorithms to optimise environmental conditions for crop growth, resulting in a 15% increase in efficiency.

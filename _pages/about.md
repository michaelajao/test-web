Hi, I'm **Michael Ajao-Olarinoye**, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning expert with over five years of experience in both academia and industry. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD in Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling at Coventry University, where I specialize in developing predictive models for **resource allocation during pandemics**.

I am passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Big Data**, and **teaching**. In addition to my research, I work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, helping students develop a deeper understanding of **Machine Learning** and **AI**. 

Some of my key achievements include:
- Developing predictive and prescriptive models for resource allocation in pandemic scenarios.
- Publishing research in **top-tier conferences** like the IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA).
- Leading **AI literacy initiatives** at the African Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AIAI).

When Iâ€™m not coding or mentoring students, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and exploring the intersection of AI and public health. I am also deeply committed to **community outreach**, teaching web development to underrepresented communities through initiatives like CodeYourFuture.

### Affiliations
- **Coventry University** - PhD Candidate, Computational Science
- **African Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AIAI)** - Head of AI Literacy
- **CodeYourFuture** - Teaching Assistant

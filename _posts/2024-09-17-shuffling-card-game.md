## Shuffling Card Game

This project is a simple and interactive **Shuffling Card Game** built using **JavaScript**. It's a web-based card game where users can shuffle a deck of cards and test their luck by drawing random cards. The game simulates real-world shuffling and provides a visual representation of the shuffled cards.

>To see the code on github codespace, go to [Shuffling Cards on Codespace](https://effective-happiness-q9rgxv74jpw24p94.github.dev/) and select the `index.html` file and then `go live` using the `go live` button at the bottom of the screen from the `live server` extension.

[**Live Demo**](https://effective-happiness-q9rgxv74jpw24p94.github.dev/)

### Features:
- **Random Shuffling**: The deck of cards is shuffled randomly on each attempt.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can visually see the cards shuffle and draw.
- **Clean and Responsive Design**: The card game is optimized for different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile.
- **Reset Option**: Players can reset the game and shuffle the deck again for a fresh start.

### Technology Stack:
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for shuffling and drawing cards.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling for the game interface.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting the game online.

### How It Works:
1. **Deck Initialization**: The deck consists of 52 cards, represented by images or text.
2. **Shuffle Functionality**: A custom shuffle algorithm is used to randomly rearrange the cards.
3. **Card Drawing**: After shuffling, the user can draw cards from the shuffled deck one by one.
4. **Game Reset**: The user has the option to reset the game, which reinitializes and shuffles the deck for a new round.

### Screenshots:

### Code Snippet:

```javascript
// Function to shuffle the deck
function shuffleDeck(deck) {
  for (let i = deck.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [deck[i], deck[j]] = [deck[j], deck[i]]; // Swap cards
  }
  return deck;
}

// Function to draw a card
function drawCard(deck) {
  return deck.pop();
}

// Initialize the deck
let deck = ["Ace of Spades", "2 of Hearts", "3 of Clubs", ...];
shuffleDeck(deck);

// Draw a card from the shuffled deck
const card = drawCard(deck);
console.log("You drew: " + card);
```

### Challenges:
- **Shuffling Algorithm**: Designing an efficient and random shuffling algorithm for the deck of cards.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the game interface is user-friendly and accessible on various devices.
- **Game Logic**: Implementing the logic for drawing cards and resetting the game state.
- **Visual Representation**: Creating an engaging visual experience for users during shuffling and drawing.
- **Hosting**: Deploying the game online and ensuring smooth performance.
- **Testing**: Ensuring the game functions correctly and handling edge cases.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Multiple Players**: Add support for multiple players to draw cards.
- **Score Tracking**: Implement a scoring system to track player performance.
- **Animations**: Include animations for shuffling and drawing cards.
- **Sound Effects**: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects.

In this project, I conducted an experiment using machine learning to analyze data from a fitness tracker. The aim of this experiment was to explore how data from fitness trackers can be leveraged to predict fitness patterns, monitor physical activity, and improve user health metrics using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

Fitness trackers collect various types of data, such as step count, heart rate, calories burned, and activity duration. This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be used to make predictions or gain insights from such data. 

Key aspects of this project include:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering and preprocessing the data from a fitness tracker dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting key features from the data such as step trends, heart rate anomalies, and calorie burn rates.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Building and training models to predict activity levels or fitness trends.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the performance of the models.

You can find the source code for this project on my GitHub repository: [Fitness Tracker Experiment with Machine Learning](https://github.com/michaelajao/fitness_tracker).

## Machine Learning Techniques Used

1. **Supervised Learning**: Predicting the type of physical activity based on the sensor data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering similar fitness patterns for personalized recommendations.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of each model with appropriate metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** for building machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experiment tracking

## Results and Insights

After training the models, I achieved significant accuracy in predicting fitness activities based on tracker data. These insights could potentially help users of fitness trackers improve their physical activity or track long-term health patterns.

Here is a summary of the findings:

- **Predicted Fitness Patterns**: Predicting different activities such as running, walking, and cycling with a reasonable accuracy.
- **Clustering Results**: Grouping users into different fitness levels based on their activity patterns.
- **Recommendations**: Providing potential recommendations based on user fitness data.

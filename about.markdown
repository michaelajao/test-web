# Hi, I'm Michael Ajao-Olarinoye

I'm a **Data Scientist**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, and **Educator** with over five years of experience in data analysis, machine learning, and web/mobile development. I specialize in building robust data-driven solutions, leveraging advanced algorithms, and designing models that solve real-world problems. My work focuses on both academic and professional projects, ranging from **deep learning**, **NLP**, and **predictive analytics** to hands-on experience in **cybersecurity** and **software engineering**.

I am currently pursuing my **PhD in Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling** at Coventry University, where my research is focused on using **physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)** and **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** to estimate the demand for mechanical ventilators at the beginning of a pandemic using epidemiological data. I also work on various projects involving machine learning applications across industries.

I have a passion for teaching and have taught across various levels, aiming to make complex concepts accessible. When I'm not coding or researching, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, writing about technology, and helping others to grow in the data science community.

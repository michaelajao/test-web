# Hi, I'm Michael Ajao-Olarinoye

I'm a **Data Scientist**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, and **Educator** with over five years of experience in data analysis, machine learning, and web/mobile development. I specialize in building robust data-driven solutions, leveraging advanced algorithms, and designing models that solve real-world problems. My work focuses on both academic and professional projects, ranging from **deep learning**, **NLP**, and **predictive analytics** to hands-on experience in **cybersecurity** and **software engineering**.
